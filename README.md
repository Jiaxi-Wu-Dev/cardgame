Libraries being considered

Phaser - "A fast fun and free open source HTML5 game framework" seems like it has many features, also has opal support

Pixi.js - "2D webGL renderer with canvas fallback", fast

Create.js - "A suite of javasscript libraries and tools designed for working with HTML5" not just games. 

Crafty.js - "A flexible framework for Javascript games" seems small and simple

gameQuery - "Javascript game engine for jQuery" works with jQuery
