Game Instructions

One player mode: match all the images in the least amount of time using WASD and TAB to select the images

Two player mode: Player One uses WASD and TAB to select images, Player Two uses Arrow Keys and spacebar to select images. Whoever finishes first is the winner.






Libraries being considered

Phaser - "A fast fun and free open source HTML5 game framework" seems like it has many features, also has opal support

Pixi.js - "2D webGL renderer with canvas fallback", fast

Create.js - "A suite of javasscript libraries and tools designed for working with HTML5" not just games. 

Crafty.js - "A flexible framework for Javascript games" seems small and simple

gameQuery - "Javascript game engine for jQuery" works with jQuery

day 1 - make the grid and give it functionality by writing functions. Make a player one board.  
functions needed would be matching the cards and wiping it off the board
the timer

make the function that whoever clears the board first (tiles on board = 0) then the persons the winner. 

2 days - working on the html/css
