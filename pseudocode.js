/* Pseudocode
Create a layout of 3x3 with different backgrounds and layer it with different shapes
Use the WASD for player one and arrow keys for player two. For player one use the tab key to select the squares. For player two use the space key to select squares. In order to complete the game, the players need to empty the board of tiles by matching two of the same images. 
In a one player scenario theres a counter to see how fast you can clear the board
In a two player scenario, theres two boards and whoever clears theres the fastest wins.  */
